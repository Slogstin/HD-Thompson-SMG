# Contents
## Thompson SMG:
    * Can spawn on Ammoboxes
    * Uses 45.LC ammunition(!)
    * Heavy and a bit more awkward to use than the PPSH-41
    * Uses both Drum and Stick magazines
    * Loadout code: TSG
    * Class: HDTommyGun

    (!)I was thinking about it using .45ACP, but decided against it, since there are already plenty ACP weapons.

    
## Thompson Drum Magazine:
    * Holds 50 rounds
    * Only spawn with the gun or (i think) in Backpacks
    * Loadout code: TM5
    * Class:  HDTommyDrum


## Thompson Stick Magazine:
    * Holds 30 rounds
    * Can spawn on wild Magazines
    * Loadout code: TM3
    * Class:  HDTommyMag
